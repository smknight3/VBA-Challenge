# VBA-Challenge

## Background
#### In this challenge, we pared down a data set to presumably extract the value of each given stock year to year. This was achieved by calculating the absolute change to see which stocks increased the most in terms of absolute dollars, the percentage to see which had the greatest change in stock price, and the total volume per stock to see which ones were traded the most. 

## Method
#### Using Microsoft Visual Basic, it was possible to neatly display the yearly change, the percent change, and the total volume of each individual stock out of a large dataset by using loops and conditionals. The primary object of this exercise was to organize the relevant results of this data through a summary table. To further enhance the legibility of the results, negative and positive yearly changes were distinguished from each other using the colors red and yellow. 

#### After having organized our data in established KPIs, we then used conditionals to determine the stocks with the highest increase in percentage, the highest decrease in percentage, and the highest total volume. These seemed to indicate the most and least successful stocks given in the dataset. 

## Limitations
#### The data finally presented from this exercise was based on the strict KPIs listed above. The second data summary table, however, could be used as a severe indicator of stock success. Although the KPIs chosen for this particular exercise seem accurate, one might be more interested in the volatility of a stock than simply its eventual outcome.
